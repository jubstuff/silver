## My role

I take problems and turn them into simple products that work for everyone.

I love helping organisations deliver products and services so that they're more efficient, simpler, faster and easier to use.

I help discover user needs and translate them into solutions to meet those needs. I do that by challenging assumptions and prototyping ideas for testing.

My work covers user journeys and navigation as well as interactions at the component level so I can see the big picture as well as the fine detail.

I **make working** software in code, not just pictures that describe it. My work is done when it's in the hands of users and delivering value.

## Title 2


I've been in digital since 2000 and my previous clients include Tesco, BBC, Just Eat, Selfridges, The Financial Times, T-Mobile, the Department for Work and Pensions, the Ministry of Justice and many more.

## Books I've written

I've written 2 books:

* Form Design Patterns is about how to design a plethora of forms for the web. Published as a beautiful hardback by Smashing Magazine in 2018.
* MaintainableCSS is about crafting modular interfaces with CSS. Self-published for free in 2016.

## Some other bits

When I’m not working, you’ll find me playing tennis, braving Insanity Max 30 and spending time with my family.
